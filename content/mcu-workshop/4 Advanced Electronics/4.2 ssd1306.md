Using the SSD1306 OLED display over I2C.
# Components
- 1x SSD1306 Display

# Instructions
Connect the VCC and GND on the display to the 3.3v and GND pins on the Pico. Connect SCL (Serial Clock) to `GP05` and SDA (Serial Data) to `GP04`.

Upload the `ssd1306_i2c.cpp` file to the Pico and watch the display print text, draw lines and flash on and off.
# Info
This display works using Inter-Integrated Circuit (IIC -> I2C). It uses two data wires: a clock and data. The protocol is command based; every time the Pico needs to tell the display something, it sends it a command with some attached data.

A useful feature of I2C is that it is address-based. This means over a hundred different peripherals can share the same two data wires, as long as they each have a unique address.

I2C does not have as high data rates as SPI.
# Exercises
> [!exercise]
> Mess around with the `main` function. See if you can edit the text that gets displayed, or draw some shapes with the `DrawLine` function.

> [!exercise]
> Integrate the display with an input component you have previously used.
> - Print text depending on whether a button is being pressed.
> - Print text showing the voltage measured from the ADC with a potentiometer.
