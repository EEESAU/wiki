title: 4.1 Ultrasonic Sensor
---
Using an ultrasonic sensor to measure distance.
# Components
- 1x Ultrasonic sensor
---
# Instructions
Connect VCC and GND to the Pico 3.3V and GND. Connect TRIG to `GP15` and ECHO to `GP14`.

Open `ultrasonic.cpp` and run it on the Pico. In the serial console, it will print out the measured distance.
# Info
The ultrasonic sensor measures distance by echolocation; it sends out a pulse of ultrasonic sound, and waits until the echo comes back. The ECHO pin goes high for the amount of time it took the sound to come back.

Use the following formula to convert to distance:

$$ d = v_{sound} \times t $$
- $v_{sound}=340 m/s$ in air.
# Exercise
> [!exercise]
> Integrate the ultrasonic sensor with another component you have used.
> - Turn on an LED if the distance crosses a threshold.
> - Dim an LED using PWM based on distance

> [!exercise]
> Use a piezo buzzer and the ultrasonic sensor to build a [theremin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theremin).
> 
> *Hint: Refer to [[2.3 pwm|Module 2.3]]*
