- 1x LED
- 1x 270 Resistor

# Instructions
Make the following connections:
- VDD to 3.3v
- GND to GND
- A0, A1, A2 (Address select pins) to GND
- RESET to 3.3v
- GP0 to an LED, then through the resistor to GND

Look at and run `output-expander.cpp`. You should see the LED flash on and off.
# Info
An output expander is useful in the case that we run out of digital pins. Since this IC uses I2C, we can connect many of them onto the same bus and get a huge amount of digital inputs or outputs.

A library was written to make using this device easier. Look in `MCP23008.h` to read the code.
# Exercises
> [!exercise]
> Look in the `MCP23008.h` file and see if you can find out how to use the output expander to read inputs. Connect a button to another pin and use it to control the LED on pin 0.

> [!exercise]
> Connect 8 LEDs to the 8 outputs of the MCP23008 and use them to recreate the [Knight Rider effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzHsz-kiKj0).
