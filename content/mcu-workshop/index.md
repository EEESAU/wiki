title: EEESAU Microcontroller Workshop
---
Welcome to the wiki for the EEESAU microcontroller workshop.

The microcontroller (uC) board that we have chosen to use for this workshop is the Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W. While many of the ideas in this guide will generalise to other kinds of uC's, we will also be going into detail about the many unique features of this board.
# About this Guide
This guide is divided into 6 sections, each relating to a different aspect of using the Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W.
1. [**Basic Programming**](mcu-workshop/1%20Basic%20Programming/index.md): Become more familiar with the development process and tools for Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W
2. [**Basic Electronics**](2%20Basic%20Electronics/basic-electronics): Interact with basic electronic components.
3. **Advanced Programming**: Learn some more sophisticated techniques of programming for Pico.
4. **Advanced Electronics**: Use protocol-based communication with integrated circuits.
5. **USB**: Explore how the Pico can interact with other devices over USB.
6. **Wireless**: Explore how the Pico can interact with other devices over Wifi and Bluetooth.
