title: 6.1 Wireless Access Point
---
Turn your Pico into a Wireless Access Point so you can connect to it like a WiFi hotspot.
# Instructions
Look at `picow_access_point.c`. You can edit the SSID (hotspot name) and password of the access point.
```c
const char *ap_name = "my_pico_1234"; // Change to something 
const char *password = "password123"; // Put in a secure password
```

Once you've chosen a password, compile the code again and load `picow_access_point_background.uf2` onto your Pico.

Once it starts running, you should see your access point appear in the WiFi options of your computer.

When you connect, you will be sent to a captive portal page to "login" to the network.
- If you don't get sent there automatically, go to http://192.168.4.1/ledtest in your browser.

From this page, you can control the LED on the Pico.

# Exercises
> [!exercise]
> The HTML that defines how the page looks is defined in the first few lines of `picow_access_point.c`. Can you spruce it up a bit to make it look nicer?

> [!exercise]
> The behaviour of the Pico when it receives an HTTP request is defined in the `test_server_content` function. What else could you do in this function that could be interesting?
