title: 2.4 ADC
---
Reading analog inputs with the Analog to Digital Converter (ADC).
# Components
- 1x potentiometer.
# C Interface
[Documentation](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/pico-sdk/hardware.html#group_hardware_adc)
```c
// Initialise the adc subsystem.
void adc_init();

// Initialise a GPIO as an ADC input.
void adc_gpio_init(uint gpio);

// Choose which GPIO goes to the ADC.
void adc_select_input(uint input);

// Read the value of the ADC. Value ranges from 0 to 4095.
uint16_t adc_read();
```

# Instructions
The Pico 2 W has a single ADC that can take input from one of three pins: `GP26`, `GP27`, `GP28`. Refer to the diagram in [[pico-info]] for further details.
## Potentiometer
Connect the left and right pins to 3.3V and GND, and the middle pin to `GP26`.

Look at and run `adc-potentiometer.cpp`, then connect to the serial port to monitor the value of the ADC.
## Builtin Temperature Sensor
Run `adc-temperaure.cpp` to see the current temperature of the Pico get printed out over the serial console.
# Explanation
There's only a single ADC on the Pico, but it can choose an input from a few different sources, so you can monitor multiple analog values by swapping between them.

The ADC has 12 bits of precision, so there are $2^{12}=4096$ possible values it can measure.
# Exercises
> [!exercise]
> Create a dimmable LED. Use the ADC to control the PWM output of an LED.

> *Hint: refer to [[2.3 pwm|2.3 PWM]]*

> [!exercise]
> Use the ADC to control the pitch of the tone on a piezo buzzer.
