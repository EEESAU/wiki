title: 1.3 Onboard LED
---
There is an LED built onto the Pico that we can control from a program.
# C Interface
```c
// Inbuilt LED is controlled by the cyw43 wireless module.
#include "pico/cyw43_arch.h"

// Initialise the wireless module
int cyw43_arch_init(void);

// Put a value onto a GPIO pin
// The builtin LED pin is defined in CYW43_WL_GPIO_LED_PIN
void cyw43_arch_gpio_put(uint wl_gpio, bool value);
```
---
# Instructions
Look at the `onboard-led.cpp` file to see how to control the onboard LED. 

The LED is green and is just next to the USB port on the Pico.

A difference on the Pico 2 W is that the LED is connected through the wireless module, rather than directly to a GPIO pin. This means we need to initialise the cyw43 module before we can use the LED.

# Exercise
> [!exercise]
> Can you integrate the LED with the [[1.2 serial-monitor|Serial Monitor]] to control the LED from your computer?
