title: 1.2 Serial Monitor
---
Using serial over USB to print messages from the Pico.
# C Interface
[Documentation](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/pico-sdk/runtime.html#group_pico_stdio)
```c
#include "pico/stdlib.h"

// Initialise the Standard I/O interface.
stdio_init_all();

// Print a formatted string
stdio_printf(const char* format, ...);
```

# Instructions
You can use a USB serial monitor program to trace output logs from the Pico. This is useful to print out some basic debugging information or to get some external input.

In the C code, you need to add the following function call to your `main()` function, to turn on the serial communication:
```c
stdio_init_all();
```

VSCode has a built-in serial monitor, you can find it as one of the tabs in the "Terminal":

Other serial monitor programs are:
- [PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html) (Windows)
- `minicom` (Linux, macOS)

Build and upload the `serial-monitor` program, connect the serial port and then reset the Pico. You should see a message appear in the log.
- On Linux/macOS, the serial port is `/dev/ttyACM0`
- On Windows, the serial port will be called `COM*` where * is a number.

## Serial Input
The serial monitor can also be used to send inputs to the Pico over USB. Open the `serial-monitor-input.cpp` file to see how to do this. 

A helper function has been written to make the process easier.
```c
size_t gets_s(char* string, size_t string_size);
```

The code in `serial-monitor-input.cpp` asks the user for a password, then prints a message depending on whether it is correct or not.

> [!Exercise]
> Can you make a **short quiz** using the serial input and output?
>
> Print a message to ask a question, and then when the user gives an answer, print out "Correct" or "Incorrect".
> 
> *Hint: use the [`strcmp`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/string/byte/strcmp) function to check if strings are equal.*
