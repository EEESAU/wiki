# How to use Picotool
Picotool is a command-line utility that can do useful things with a Pico connected over USB.
## Installation
The easiest way to install Picotool is to download the pre-built versions.

Go to https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk-tools/releases
- Windows: `picotool-x.x.x-x64-win.zip`
- Linux: `picotool-x.x.x-x86_64-lin.zip`
- macOS: `picotool-x.x.x-mac.zip`

Inside the zip file will be an executable called `picotool` (`picotool.exe` on Windows)

If you're on Linux or macOS, it's also easy to build it yourself: https://github.com/raspberrypi/picotool
## Usage
Connect the Pico over USB and place it in `BOOTSEL` mode.

Get info on the connected Pico:
```shell
<path to picotool executable>/picotool.exe info
```

Upload an executable file to the Pico:
```shell
<path to picotool executable>/picotool.exe load build/onboard_led.uf2
```
- You can use the `load` command on a Pico that's not in `BOOTSEL` mode, as long as it has USB serial functionality enabled (Try with the [[1.2 serial-monitor|Serial Monitor]] programs).

Remotely reset the Pico:
```shell
<path to picotool executable>/picotool.exe reboot
```
