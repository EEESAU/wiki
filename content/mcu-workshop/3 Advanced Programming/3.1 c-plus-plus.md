title: 3.1 C++
---
Writing C++ code to run on the Pico.

---
# Instructions
Look at `c-plus-plus.cpp` to see examples of how to use C++ in microcontroller code.

Since our toolchain is based on GCC, and the SDK is written in C, we get C++ support for free due to backwards compatibility. That means you can use many of the features of C++ for embedded programming on a Pico.

Object-oriented programming in C++ is useful for embedded development, since we can create C++ objects that represent the various components and peripherals connected to our Pico.
# Exercises
> [!exercise]
> Create a C++ class to represent an LED.
> 
> Class template:
> ```c++
> class LED {
> public:
> 	// Setup the pin as an output.
> 	LED(uint gpio);
> 
> 	// Turn the LED on or off.
> 	void set_state(bool state);
> };
> ```

> [!exercise]
> Create a C++ class to represent a button input.
> 
> Class template:
> ```c++
> class Button {
> public:
> 	// Set pin as input and configure pullup/pulldown
> 	Button(uint gpio);
> 	
> 	// Return whether the button is pressed or not.
> 	bool is_pressed();
> };
