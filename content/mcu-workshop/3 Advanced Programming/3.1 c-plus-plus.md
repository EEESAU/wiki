Writing C++ code to run on the Pico.

# Instructions
Look at `c-plus-plus.cpp` to see examples of how to use C++ in microcontroller code.

Since our toolchain is based on GCC, and the SDK is written in C, we get C++ support for free due to backwards compatibility. That means you can use many of the features of C++ for embedded programming on a Pico.
